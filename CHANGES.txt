June 25 2015 (Patrick Fallberg):
    First version of my generic MySensors node
    
    Features:
    - Switchable battery level measurement
    - By-passable 3.3V step-up regulator
    - Possibility to disable sensor power rail
    - Optional additional 5V step-up regulator for sensors
    - 2.5mm DC jack power supply footprint
    - 2mm pitch JST connector for LiPo batteries
    - Both RF24 and RF69 footprints and possibility for interrupt connectivity
    - External SPI flash
    - AVR ISP programming header
    - ATSHA204A authenticatior footprint
    - On-board I2C pullups
    - On-board sensor ports (all with 3.3 and 5V rails):
      - 1 PWM enabled sensor port
      - 2 HW interrupt sensor ports (1 optionally taken by radio)
      - 2 generic I/O sensor ports that also provide HW UART
      - 1 SPI header
      - 2 Analog sensor ports
      - 2 I2C sensor ports
    
    Known issues:
    - The layout of CON1 is incorrect with respect to normal battery
      connectors so battery polarity will be reversed. Do NOT connect
      a battery with JST connector to this board (Rev 1.0).
    
    - 3.3V regulator has an unterminated EN-signal. That means it could
      start up in "off" state which mean that if battery level is too high
      (>4.1V) SPI flash could fry. If battery level is too low (<1.8V),
      MCU might not start in order to enable the regulator.
      A workaround if this situation is undesirable is to solder a pull-up
      resistor between REG_BYPASS and +BATT signals.
    
    - Pull-ups are missing on SPC CS signals which may lead to undetermined
      behaviour on some SPI devices.
    
    - The 5V regulator does not work proerly when cascaded with the 3.3v regulator.
      It should not be mounted on this board, or the board should be rewired to connect
      the 5V regulator directly to +BATT.
    
    - DC input is inadequatly bypassed for wall warts. It is recommended to add one or two
      additional capacitors to suppres input noise (~47 to ~470uF).
