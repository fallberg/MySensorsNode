    Created a BOM generator script for this project
    
    The BOM generator (verified on KiCad for Linux) parses the netllist
    data and outputs 9 BOM files:
    MySensorsNode_Full.txt - Full BOM with all suppliers
    MySensorsNode_Cheapest.txt - BOM with the cheapest supplier
    MySensorsNode_AliExpress.txt - BOM with all parts available from AliExpress
    MySensorsNode_Digi-Key.txt - BOM with all parts available from Digi-Key
                                 This file is supported by Digi-Keys Text File
                                 Import tool.
    MySensorsNode_eBay.txt - BOM with all parts available from eBay
    MySensorsNode_Elfa.txt - BOM with all parts available from Elfa
                             This file is suppored by Elfas Own list upload tool.
    MySensorsNode_Farnell.txt - BOM with all parts available from Farnell
    MySensorsNode_Mouser.csv - BOM with all parts available from Mouser
                               This file is supported by Mousers BOM import tool.

    Completed sourcing details of all components
    
    Sourcing data is organized in the following way:
    Supplier1 - The primary supplier (also the cheapest)
    Supplier1 part - The primary supplier part number
    Supplier1 link - Link to the part on the suppliers homepage
    
    The same goes for Supplier2 to 5.
    All parts also have a Vendor and Vendor part field to identify
    a vendor for each part.

    Rev. 1.1 of my generic MySensors node
    
    * Added resistor to terminate REG_BYPASS to default 'on' (fixes #2)
    * Added extra RF bypass capacitors (fixes #5)
    * Updated RF69 footprint to have sligtly wider space between holes
    * Added optional pull-ups to CS signals on SPI devices (fixes #3)
    * Reversed polarity of CON1 to fit battery default pinout (fixes #1)
    * Sensor pin connector swapped in favor of MYSX 1.5 connector

    * Discarded 5V regulator and added a different 3.3V reg for 12V input (fixes #4)
    * Created layout for Superbat box BOX-2252
    
    Things left to do:
    * Update schematic with full sourcing details

commit d8ca8d24746c1e1fc214979bb362ea2246e7586e
Author: Patrick Fallberg <patrick@fallberg.net>

    First version of my generic MySensors node
    
    Features:
    - Switchable battery level measurement
    - By-passable 3.3V step-up regulator
    - Possibility to disable sensor power rail
    - Optional additional 5V step-up regulator for sensors
    - 2.5mm DC jack power supply footprint
    - 2mm pitch JST connector for LiPo batteries
    - Both RF24 and RF69 footprints and possibility for interrupt connectivity
    - External SPI flash
    - AVR ISP programming header
    - ATSHA204A authenticatior footprint
    - On-board I2C pullups
    - On-board sensor ports (all with 3.3 and 5V rails):
      - 1 PWM enabled sensor port
      - 2 HW interrupt sensor ports (1 optionally taken by radio)
      - 2 generic I/O sensor ports that also provide HW UART
      - 1 SPI header
      - 2 Analog sensor ports
      - 2 I2C sensor ports
    
    Known issues:
    - The layout of CON1 is incorrect with respect to normal battery
      connectors so battery polarity will be reversed. Do NOT connect
      a battery with JST connector to this board (Rev 1.0).
    
    - 3.3V regulator has an unterminated EN-signal. That means it could
      start up in "off" state which mean that if battery level is too high
      (>4.1V) SPI flash could fry. If battery level is too low (<1.8V),
      MCU might not start in order to enable the regulator.
      A workaround if this situation is undesirable is to solder a pull-up
      resistor between REG_BYPASS and +BATT signals.
    
    - Pull-ups are missing on SPC CS signals which may lead to undetermined
      behaviour on some SPI devices.
    
    - The 5V regulator does not work proerly when cascaded with the 3.3v regulator.
      It should not be mounted on this board, or the board should be rewired to connect
      the 5V regulator directly to +BATT.
    
    - DC input is inadequatly bypassed for wall warts. It is recommended to add one or two
      additional capacitors to suppres input noise (~47 to ~470uF).
